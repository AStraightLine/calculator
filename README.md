1. If I was to rebuild this project, the first thing I'd do differently is split up the operation button listeners, this would remove lots of filtering logic and work arounds, along with making it far more readable. This would also make implementing keyboard support infinitely easier and more efficient. If I was to implement keyboard support I would first rewrite the program in a more modular fashion. 

2. Fixed dividing 0 by something bug.
3. Styling upgrade.
4. Implemented 'subDisplay' to help user keep track of their inputs.
5. Implemented C button for removing last digit entered if last entry was a digit, not operator. 
6. Implemented block to entering multiple floating points.
7. Worked around the pressing '=' before any other input bug.
8. Implemented digit amount limitation and corresponding rounding. 
9. Fixed multiplication / division as first operation bug. 
10. Fixed even nastier chain operations bug when chaining after an equals.
11. Fixed nasty chain operations bug.
12. Fixed float bug.
13. Linked user input with operation functionality. 
14. Implemented clear button functionality.
15. Implemented initial displayValue setting.
16. Basic styling.
17. Basic calculation functions.
18. Project setup.
